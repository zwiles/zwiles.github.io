      <h4>Digital Natives Project</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">12/5: Meet with Eni to start discusing topics for my final project<br>12/7: I went to helproom and Anne helped me write beginning scripts to help with my project.</p><br>
      <h4>Final Project Idea</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">  My final project idea is to track what ads Facebook shows me based on my recent searches. I learned that I can learn about what Facebook knows about me like political party, age, and race. After analyzing that data, I want to see if based on what I search and sites I vist, Facebook displays certain ads. I want to create three or four different experiments using selenium searches. In the searches, they will visit a website I commonly use, log in to my account if I have one, and look around, maybe start to make a purchase but just live it in the cart. Based on that, I would like to see if Facebook will show me more ads based on what recently did on google. The websites I will use is an airline I commonly use, a store I shop online, just looking through makeup site and maybe looking at reviews, and maybe a restaurant place. 
      <br>  It might also be interesting to create a fake Facebook account and see if I can see if I can manipulate what Facebook knows about this person. I can do this by liking pages and posts on Facebook. Then by creating certain searches on Google, if Facebook shows certain ads. Facebook has already collected data on me so it would be interesting to see what they do with a new user because Facebook makes money on its ads. 
      <br> To show my results, I will write a script to collect every ad that shows on Facebook. I will then see which ads or for the sites I had recently used. </p><br>
      <h4>Digital Natives: OLS Models</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Under construction</p><br>
      <h4>Digital Natives Paragraph</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Both excerpts mentioned how today’s teenagers have pretty much lived their entire lives on the internet. I grew up in a generation with MySpace, the beginnings of Facebook, and various other social media sites. Most of the lives of my peers are online which creates everyone’s digital footprint. It would be interesting to find my personal digital footprint. I would want to research what information I would be able to find on myself with a little searching on the internet. Some of the ways I can research this and just put my name on search engines and see all the results and then maybe find a way to find which Zoe Wiles is actually me. From there, any relevant information will be used to create a profile of me to outline my digital footprint. </p><br>
